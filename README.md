# Rustfit

Fitness studio management SaaS.

## Technical Decisions

### Decisions and Alternatives

Rust is the programming language.
This decision is based on my wish to learn and explore the language. We can
also justify using Rust because of the small binary and closer to the metal
code it compiles to. Rust's type system is also a great tool.

Axum is the web application framework.
As it is just a thin layer on top of tokio, our async runtime for Rust.

sqlite is the database.
Because of its simplicity and ease of deployment.

sqlx is the SQL toolkit of choice.
We've decided not to use an ORM to keep the project flexible and simple using
SQL directly.

## Project
